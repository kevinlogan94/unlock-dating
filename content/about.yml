  ## My Journey

  ## Where It Started

  My journey started when I was 13 years old. I had just started dating my first girlfriend and was on top of the world.
  I thought we were going to be together forever. But, unfortunately, fate had another plan. After 2 weeks of us being together,
  she broke up with me to get back together with her ex-boyfriend. I was crushed. How could this girl who was so into me suddenly
  pivot so hard? I don't understand!
  <br><br>
  Little did I know that moments like these were actually a blessing in disguise. And that is when, faced with these situations,
  we get to choose how we respond to them. Is this the worst thing to happen to me? Or is it the best thing to happen to me?
  <br><br>
  In my case, I always went with the latter. I wanted to understand how I had somehow messed up so bad that the girl that I thought was
  the love of my life had turned on me so quickly. I later learned that it was never actually me. But, in the moment, I took this opportunity to level up.
  I had no pursuits in my life, I was overweight, and had genuinely nothing to offer her or any other girl. If I wanted to fix this, I needed to fix myself first.
  <br><br>
  I went hard, I lost 40 points in a month, focusing every day on the pain of losing her and the shame of being rejected. I also started drumline at my local
  high school marching band. I now had a purpose and my fitness in check. This landed me a new girlfriend who treated me way better.
  Within a year, I was the drumline section leader at my high school, which was a very high position. And suddenly, not only was my first girlfriend trying to get
  back together with me, but I was also getting approached by other, more attractive girls. Not only did I accomplish getting my ex to come back, but I also had new girls competing for me.

  ## Learning the Hard Way

  This is when I hit a new roadblock. I started dating a new girl, and I thought she was the one. But this relationship was weird. She would be super
  sweet to me at the very beginning of our relationship, but once I told her how I felt, she would turn into a completely different person. I was confused.
  How could this 10/10 girl turn into a 1/10 girl so quickly? This turned into an on-and-off relationship through my high school years, which ended when I officially
  ended the relationship in my first year of college. I had wasted so much time dating a girl pretending to be what I wanted just to come out as who she really was once
  she was secure.
  <br><br>
  I later learned that we tend to do this. Women will put up a mask of what their man wants in an attempt to pull them in. Then, the man will assume that that is who she really is
  and fall in love with the mask. Later to learn that they are someone else entirely. But, struggle to let go of the woman that they truly fell in love with when they realize their
  woman isn't that person. I spent years thinking I could help her become the woman that she was pretending to be.

  ## Finding My Power

  After spending so much time stuck in a relationship cycle with a woman pretending. I promised myself that I wouldn't jump into a new relationship until I knew who I was actually dating.
  I entered college and began exploring my options. I was seeing 2-3 women a week and felt like an absolute stud. This is when I really started to make some breakthroughs in my awareness with women and truly
  understand them. This is when I had men start to approach me and ask, "How are you so good with women?" But back then, my response was always, "I have no idea, but what I'm doing works!"
  This question really made me wonder and think about what I was doing. After keeping this up for a while, I realized my approach wasn't working for me. I started having a desire
  for true connection, and was curious if I could do it right this time.
  <br><br>
  This is when I met a new girl who was everything I wanted in a woman. She was beautiful, caring, and truly loved me for who I was. I felt like I could tell her anything and she would support me.
  I slowly stopped seeing the other girls and started focusing on her. After college, I moved back to my hometown and asked her to come with me. She agreed, but only
  if we got married. I truly loved this woman, so I agreed to move forward with the marriage. We moved in together and started our new life together. I proposed almost a year after we moved, and she said yes!
  I was on top of the world. I finally found the woman of my dreams. I'll never forget how happy my parents and siblings were for me. It was truly incredible.

  ## My Breaking Point

  Suddenly, about 2 months before our wedding, things started to change. She started spending late nights at the office and kept bringing up this guy there. At the time, I was so secure in our relationship
  that I didn't think anything of it. I trusted her completely. But her behavior kept getting worse. Before long, she was insulting me and doing everything she could to poke at my self-confidence. I remember sitting
  her down a week before our wedding and saying, "Is there anything that you need to tell me? Are we good to move forward with this?" She said everything was fine and that she was happy to move forward.
  Everything was not fine.
  <br><br>
  The wedding day came, but things were still off. Something was wrong. We came home, and she started telling me how hard marriage was. I didn't understand. Had we been married for only 3 days?
  We went on our honeymoon 3 months later, and I finally figured out what was going on. She sat me down and said, "There is someone else." I was destroyed. It was in that moment that my entire perception of reality changed, and who I was as a person could never be the same again. I'll never forget being on the floor of that hotel room in Germany, crying in pain because the love of my life was fucking someone else, and she just stood there and watched me.
  How could I, someone who had overcome so many obstacles with women, who was a role model to so many men, suddenly fail?

  ## The Breakthrough

  I learned that as we progress in life, life demands more from us. The challenges we face become harder and require all of our past experiences and knowledge to overcome them. I flew back home to the States, grabbed my things,
  moved back into my parents' house, filed for divorce, and started to rebuild my life. Little did I know that this was a true turning point for me. I had a lot of motivation to improve myself and had so many new resources to level up.
  I made a promise to myself to truly understand why this had happened to me and how to make sure this could never happen to me or any loved one again. This is when my true hero arc started, a period of my life that I couldn't be
  more proud of.
  <br><br>
  I took a step back and started to truly understand the world around me. I started diving deep into human psychology. Why do we behave the way that we do? What motivates men? What motivates women? What attracts women to men and vice versa?
  I started connecting all the dots of my past experiences and focused even harder on the question men kept asking me in college: "How are you so good with women?" I was determined to find the answer to this.
  After reading countless books, watching countless videos, taking dating coaching courses, and applying that knowledge to my life. I finally found the answer.
  <br><br>
  With my awareness, I finally understood what I was doing wrong. Yes, I overcame so many obstacles from my younger years, but the piece I was missing was the why! Why do we women do these things? What do they want from a man? What do they emotionally
  respond to? and, above all, how to read a woman's level of attraction towards you. All of this and more became clear to me.

  ## Mastery

  I was able to take this awareness, apply it, and have the best relationship experiences of my life. I'm talking about having women crazy head over heels in love with me. But, not only that, but they are women that I am just as crazy about. It's truly incredible to see a woman
  who you think is drop-dead gorgeous and incredible, completely open her heart for you. You feel like a God!
