If you're reading this, you probably already know the answer. That gut feeling you have? It's real, and it's trying to protect you.
<br><br>
First and foremost, it's really important during the initial dating phase to filter these kinds of women out. There are usually a couple of tells you can spot within the first two dates to figure out if a girl is a cheater. But in this article, I want to focus on a different scenario: you're already in a relationship, and you're trying to figure out if she's cheating on you or not.
<br><br>
What I'm going to do is take you through the phases she's going to go through, what to expect, and most importantly, what you need to do about it.

## Phase 1: The Depression Stage

The first stage you're going to notice is what looks like a deep depression. She's going to seem really sad and withdrawn when you're around. She's just really, really down and doesn't want to do anything.
<br><br>
This is happening because what she needs from you isn't being met. She doesn't feel loved by you. She doesn't feel protected by you. She doesn't feel safe with you. This is simply because you haven't been showing up in the relationship like you should be.
<br><br>
It's the man's job to lead the relationship. It's the man's job to invest in the relationship and build it. If you're not doing that, women will assume that she's just not worth it. She's going to start to feel pathetic, worthless, or just not worth your time.
<br><br>
This depression phase can last anywhere from two to four weeks.

## Phase 2: The Resentment Stage

Once she's gone through that depression, she's going to start being snarky with you. She's going to poke at you. She's going to pull at your confidence and try to make you feel bad because her resentment is coming out.
<br><br>
She's upset. She knows that being super depressed isn't doing anything, so she needs some other way to express her frustration.
<br><br>
During this phase, she might subtly bring up the idea of an open relationship. Some girls will do this, some won't. Some will just jump right into the next phase.

## Phase 3: Pursuing Other Options

This is when things start to get weird, and the signs become more obvious.

### Her Phone Becomes a Fortress

You're going to notice that she's always hiding her phone from you. She's going to be in the other room texting somebody. If you ever try to look at her phone, she's going to pull it away from you as much as she can.

### She Withholds Sex

She's going to start withholding sex from you. She's not going to want to have sex with you at all, and the reason is because she's saving that for somebody else.
<br><br>
Women know that men respect sexual exclusivity, so she's going to have the mental model that she needs to save it for this other guy.

### Increased Distance

She's going to be super distant emotionally. Plans will become vague. She won't commit to things like she used to.

## The Hard Truth You Need to Hear

By this point, it's important to understand that **the relationship is already dead**.
<br><br>
The direct reality is that once she starts sleeping with another guy, there is no coming back. The genie's out of the bottle. The relationship is already over. What you're in now is a shell of a relationship. You're simply together, but any chance of the relationship being what you want it to be is essentially destroyed.

## What You Need to Do

Since your role in the relationship is to be the leader, to be the man, you're going to have to be the one that breaks up with her. You're going to be the one that ends the relationship.
<br><br>
The best possible outcome you can get out of this is that you end the relationship, and then she begins to pursue you afterwards and hooks up with you. But that's as far as it's going to go.
<br><br>
**I'm going to be point blank with you:** Your chances of fixing what's going on with this girl are so low it's ridiculous. There's just no hope.

## But You Won't Listen (And That's Okay)

Now, I expect that you, reading this article right now, don't want to do that. You don't want to break up with her. You probably love her, and you probably miss her.
<br><br>
Right now, I challenge you to ask yourself: **"Why is she so depressed? What started Phase 1?"**
<br><br>
Usually, the answer is that there's something about her that you do not like, that you really don't like, and that stopped you from pursuing and trying to build a relationship with her. You didn't want to end the relationship because you were comfortable and you wanted things to just progress as they were.
<br><br>
It's really important for you to remember: right now you probably feel like you need to pursue because she's pulling away, but that one thing you really don't like about her is not going to go away. That's just part of who she is.

## What's Going to Happen Next

Most of you guys are not going to break up with her. Most of you are just going to try to keep things going as long as you can, or you're simply going to do nothing.
<br><br>
What's going to eventually happen is **she's going to be the one that breaks up with you**. She's not going to break up with you until one of these guys she's seeing outside the relationship gives her some kind of promise, like she thinks that she's got him secured to some extent. Then she's going to end the relationship.

## Prepare Your Exit Strategy

When that happens, you need to be prepared. Right now, if you're not ready to break up with her, I at the very least ask you to begin thinking about recovery.
<br><br>
If she breaks up with you when everything goes down, what are you going to do?
<br><br>
- Do you guys live together? If so, you need to be prepared to move out.
- Where are you going to go? Do you have family or friends you can stay with?
- What's your financial situation?
- Who's your support system?
<br><br>
You have to be prepared for all of these things, and you need to be able to move fast when this happens.

## My Final Advice

This situation you are in is an awful situation. I've been there myself. Trust me, I get it.
<br><br>
It is **so critical** for you, your confidence, your self-esteem, and your ability to find new partners that you get out of this relationship as quickly as you possibly can and focus on healing and building yourself back up.
<br><br>
That way, you can find women that are far better than the woman you're dating right now.
<br><br>
I can guarantee that the reason all this is happening is because there's something about the current girl you're dating that you just do not like. And deep down, you know what that is.
