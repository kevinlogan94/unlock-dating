In your dating life, you're going to encounter women that are going to try to cheat on you. The key is to be able to find and filter these women out quickly. But if you aren't able to do that, and you're already in a relationship with one and already have a strong connection, then this becomes a whole different game.

Women tend to do this when they don't feel a strong emotional connection in their relationship. It's important to understand that cheating happening isn't because of you, it's because of a flaw with her. If she's not fulfilled in that relationship, it's up to her to be the one to end it and walk away.

All right, here are the signs for you to look out for:

## 1. Hiding her phone

Is she hiding her cell phone? This is the easiest tell. You'll notice that her phone is always gone. She's always trying to hide her phone from you. She gets mean whenever you touch her phone.

## 2. Texting in secret

You'll notice that she is texting. You'll probably notice that she's texting somebody, but she always tries to hide her phone from you. It seems as if she's trying to text somebody in secret from you.

## 3. Depression

You're going to notice that she's very depressed.
 Usually, the depression part comes first. You'll start noticing that she's just super, super depressed, and when she's in that mood, she's far more inclined to say yes when approached by a guy.

## 4. Spotty scheduling plans

She won't be as inclined to hang out, or she'll start being a little wishy-washy when it comes to scheduling plans with you.You'll hear her say things like, "Yeah, I'll try to make that work," or, "Yeah, we'll have to play it by ear. I'm not so sure what my schedule looks like right now." Where, beforehand, she would tell you immediately that she was good or that she was happy to schedule it.

## 5. Distance

You'll notice she won't be as interested in having sex with you, or she might be withholding sex entirely.

At this point, it means that she's trying to essentially prove to the other guy that she's sexually loyal to him. Women know that men care about exclusivity when it comes to sex.

## 6. Rudeness

She will probably start being rude towards you. Where originally she was being sweet and loving, now she's trying to pull you down. Toxic women will do this because they already know that they've emotionally checked out of the relationship, and they're trying to make it harder for you to move on because she wants to make it so she could theoretically move on to this next guy. If that fails, she wants to be able to have the opportunity to come back to you.

# The Hard Advice

The reality is, if you're reading this article, she probably is cheating on you. We as a species have developed a survival mechanism that essentially gives us that gut feeling if our partner is cheating on us. But as a man, you probably don't want to take any kind of action unless you have some kind of proof. Your rational brain is probably telling you to find that proof, but I'm going to tell you now that you will not find it. Finding proof is rare unless you're willing to get your hands dirty!

If you confront her about it, she is probably going to do everything she can to gaslight you. In my experience, when I've tried to confront them, they'll try to give you a really quick remark back to dissolve the situation and try to escape. Like, they'll try to walk into another room or try to walk away from you to try to disengage from the conversation.

So it's important to realize that the only way out of this situation is to just go ahead and break up with her. I know that sounds excruciating. 

The reality is, you have to ask yourself, why is she pulling away in the first place? Why would she do this all in the first place? And it's usually because there's something about her that you don't like and that turned you off from her. And the only reason that you're doing this now is because she's pulling away and you want to pursue because you want to have that security back. 

I'm going to tell you straight, there is no way to fix this. When a woman hits that point and she checks out from you and starts hooking up with some other dude, your relationship can't go back the way it was. The best you can possibly do is break up with her, and then she tries to hook up with you after that point.

If you just let the relationship continue, with all this continuing to happen, what's going to happen is she's going to eventually break up with you once she feels like she has this other guy secure.

# Recovery

With all that said, if you're like most guys, you probably won't break up with her and will try to find a way to fix things all the way up until the very end. 

If that is you, I hope you at least start thinking through your exit strategy. Stop focusing so much on fixing it and instead focus on what you would do once the relationship ends. How would you recover? How would you support yourself? What friends would you go to? Family would you go to? And so on and so forth.
