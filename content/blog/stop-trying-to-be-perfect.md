Through my time in the attraction game, trying to understand what women want, what they're looking for, what they want to emotionally connect to, and how to be more attractive to women, society has consistently told you one thing:
<br><br>
You need to be this strong, confident guy with apex confidence who's super alpha, has no insecurities, and just needs to be confident.
<br><br>
**In my 15 years of dating, I've realized that this advice is actually a cop-out. And it's what's fucking us up the most.**

## The Mask That Pushes Women Away

Here's what typically happens: Guys go out into the world and try to be this image that they think women want them to be. But here's the problem: women, with their intuition, will see right through that. They'll think, "This guy is faking it," and they'll pull away.
<br><br>
Then guys think, "Okay cool, so I need to build myself up to be this strong, confident guy that can do anything, that is super successful, makes millions of dollars."
<br><br>
**The answer is actually no.**

## What Women Really Value

In my experience, I've realized that **women tend to value connection over success** when it comes to the man they choose.
<br><br>
They want someone who they feel like they have some kind of connection with, someone they can relate to. And usually, the main way that people connect with each other is through their flaws.
<br><br>
If you're trying to build yourself up to become this unstoppable person that can do anything, that has all these things that social media tells you you need to be, you're actually hurting yourself more.

## The Real Path Forward

Now, should you be going to the gym and exercising to get fit? Yes.
<br><br>
Should you be working on your passion projects? Yes.
<br><br>
Should you be living a fully fulfilled life? Absolutely.
<br><br>
**But you don't need to sculpt yourself into some different character that society is telling you you need to be in order to be attractive.**
<br><br>
Here's the truth: There are guys out there who are insecure that women like, love, and appreciate.

## Stop Attacking Yourself

The main thing to take away from this is that you shouldn't be attacking yourself for not being this apex alpha male.
<br><br>
You should be focusing on just living a fulfilled life, living a life that you love. What will happen over time is this: you're living this life you love, you're really happy, you're enjoying yourself, you're doing all these things, you're on your mission, you're on your purpose.
<br><br>
**Women will notice this and will naturally want to become a part of it.**
<br><br>
That's the main thing to hold on to.

## Women Can Smell Authenticity

Women will always be able to smell out who you really are. And the women that you really want in your life are naturally going to, very quickly and easily, just want to be with you.
<br><br>
When you're dating a new girl, you always want to be reading her attraction level. You always want to go for the girls that, right out of the gate, near the beginning, have a high level of attraction.
<br><br>
These are the girls you really want to spend your time with because:
<br><br>
- These are the girls that are going to lift you up
- These are the girls that are going to motivate you to be the best version of yourself
- These are the girls that make you want to get disciplined
- These are the girls that make you want to be strong
- These are the girls that make you want to go to the gym
- These are the girls that make you want to make that extra $100
- These are the girls that make you want to be successful because you want to be everything that makes her proud
<br><br>
You want to show up as the best version of yourself for her because she makes you feel a certain way.

## Own Your Flaws

My big thing is: don't focus so much on becoming something that society tells you you need to become.
<br><br>
**If you have character flaws, own them.**
<br><br>
- Be okay being a little insecure
- Be okay having some feminine tendencies
- Be okay with your imperfections
<br><br>
Even me? I have feminine tendencies. I have my own insecurities. I have anxiety that I actively have to deal with.
<br><br>
We all have our own flaws, red flags, and issues. It's all about just finding the right person who understands that and will appreciate that. Again, going back to how we connect over our flaws.

## The Relief You've Been Looking For

I hope that this message really hits home with you and gives you some sense of relief that **you don't need to be anything more than who you are**.
<br><br>
You need to focus more on showing the best version of yourself to the world by living that happy, fulfilled life.
<br><br>
Go out there. Focus on the things that bring you joy and contentment. Know you don't need to make a million dollars. Know you don't need to be the smartest guy in the room. Know you don't need to be the best guy at everything.
<br><br>
**Just follow these principles:** If you understand how women operate and think, and you know how to interact with them and bring them into your life, you're going to be set up for success when she shows up.
